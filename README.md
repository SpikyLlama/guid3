- Format the GUI better
- Make a .exe release
# Installation
To install, run PowerShell. Change directory using `cd` until you get to the folder with the main.py and requirements.txt files. Type in PowerShell, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then double-click the main.py file. It should now work.
