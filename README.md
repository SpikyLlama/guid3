# guid3
A program made to edit ID3 audio metadata tags using eyed3. Still in early, early development. Many more features to come. 
# To-do
- ~~Read tags for a file, not just apply them~~
- ~~Change window color~~
- Album art API stuffs
- JSON settings file
- Edit more complex tags
- Format the GUI better
- Make a .exe release
# Installation
To install, run PowerShell. Change directory using `cd` until you get to the folder with the main.py and requirements.txt files. Type in PowerShell, `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, then double-click the main.py file. It should now work.
