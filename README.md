# guid3
A program made to edit ID3 audio metadata tags using eyed3. Still in early, early development.
# Installation
To install, run PowerShell. Change directory using `cd` until you get to the folder with the main.py and requirements.txt files. Type in PowerShell, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then double-click the main.py file. It should now work.
